## About Me
Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently a PhD student in the Cell and Molecular Biology Program at Colorado State University. 

My research is focused on non-tuberculous mycobacteria in the [Jackson Lab](https://labs.vetmedbiosci.colostate.edu/jackson/) at CSU.
My scientific interests include drug discovery, antimicrobial resistance, and host-pathogen interactions. 

I also enjoy communicating science through data visualization, and you can find a link to a portfolio of my work below!
